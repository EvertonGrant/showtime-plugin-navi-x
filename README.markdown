This is a plugin porting Navi-X for Showtime.
This is yet a WIP, so it is not available for public just yet, but should be when development is more advanced.

If you want to donate to the creator (facanferff) please click the link below but read first the notes available too:
1. I don't accept donations for new features.
2. Every donation is a way of thanking the creator for the work he had, so you're not forced to donate.
3. Donations will be used by the creator in books to advance (or get new) knowledges in Computer Science.
